# Pseudorandom Numbers
## What is a pseudorandom number?
Random numbers are called psuedo-random numbers when they are generated by some deterministic process but they qualify the predetermined statistical test for randomness. The sequence of numbers generated by such process is completely determined by the input data (or the first random number) used for the method.

## Algorithms to generate random numbers
### 1. Middle-square method
The method was invented by John von Neumann, and was described by him at a conference in 1949.

To generate a sequence of n-digit pseudorandom numbers, an n-digit starting value is created and squared, producing a 2n-digit number. If the result has fewer than 2n digits, leading zeroes are added to compensate. The middle n digits of the result would be the next number in the sequence and returned as the result. This process is then repeated to generate more numbers.
