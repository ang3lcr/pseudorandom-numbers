# Pseudorandom Numbers
## What is a pseudorandom number?
Random numbers are called psuedo-random numbers when they are generated by some deterministic process but they qualify the predetermined statistical test for randomness. The sequence of numbers generated by such process is completely determined by the input data (or the first random number) used for the method.
